            <h1>Vincent Van Gogh</h1>
            <p>
                Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890) was a Dutch post-impressionist painter who is among the most famous and
                influential figures in the history of Western art. In just over a decade, he created about 2,100
                artworks, including around 860 oil paintings most of which date from the last two years of his life.

                <p style="background-color: rgb(225, 198, 248);">
                    Van Gogh created more than 43 self-portraits between 1885 and 1889. They were usually
                    completed in series, such as those painted in Paris in mid-1887, and continued until shortly
                    before his
                    death. Generally the portraits were studies, created during introspective periods when he
                    was
                    reluctant to mix with others, or when he lacked models, and so painted himself.
